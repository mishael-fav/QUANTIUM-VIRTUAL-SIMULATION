This repository contains my solution to the [Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data-Analytics?ref=DsEXFixxovqkRxR2u) on Forage.

## Introduction

Quantium, founded in 2002, has a strong legacy of data science innovation across various industries. As a rapidly growing global leader in data science and AI, the company is dedicated to building a team that is ambitious, diverse, and collaborative.

In this program, Quantium shares transactional and customer data from a major grocery client. As part of the analytics team, our role is to deliver data-driven insights and commercial recommendations to support strategic decision-making.

## Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

In this task, I analyzed transaction data to uncover customer purchasing behaviors and provide actionable insights.

- **Data Cleaning:** Reviewed the transaction dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and misclassified items. Cleaned the dataset accordingly to ensure accuracy during analysis.

- **Customer Data Review:** Assessed the customer dataset for similar issues (e.g., null values), and merged it with the cleaned transaction data for a comprehensive view.

- **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Defined relevant metrics such as total sales, key sales drivers, and high-performing segments. Used data visualization (charts and graphs) to explore trends and highlight insights for reporting.

- **Segmentation & Recommendations:** Identified customer segments with the highest potential. Evaluated product preferences (e.g., packet sizes) and suggested targeting strategies based on observed patterns.

## Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

This task extended the previous analysis to assess the performance of trial store layouts using control stores for benchmarking.

- **Control Store Selection:** Defined key metrics to identify appropriate control stores. Visualized drivers of sales to justify control store suitability and developed functions to automate selection.

- **Trial Assessment:** Compared each trial store’s performance with its control counterpart to evaluate the layout impact. Assessed sales uplift and derived meaningful insights from the comparison.

- **Summary & Recommendations:** Compiled findings for each store and formulated recommendations to be shared with the client, focusing on the effectiveness of the trial during the test period.

## Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application

In the final task, insights from Tasks 1 and 2 were synthesized into a business-facing report for the client’s Category Manager.

- **Client Reporting:** Compiled a report for Julia, the Category Manager, with strategic insights derived from the analysis. The report aimed to inform planning for the next half-year period.

- **Pyramid Principle Framework:** Structured the report using the Pyramid Principle to ensure clarity, impact, and executive-readiness. (You can explore this framework online if you're unfamiliar with it.)

- **Deliverables:** Included visualizations, key takeaways, actionable insights, and recommended next steps, adhering to Quantium’s best practices in data storytelling.
